# Host standard library

**Status: every module on this page is implemented, and so is `airsl test`. What remains proposed
is Tier 3 and the JSON `null` sentinel.**

Everything a script can reach arrives under one Lua global, `airsstack`, as subtables installed from
Rust. This document is the roster, the reasoning, and the rules every module follows.

## Why a host stdlib at all

The answer that sounds right and is wrong: "because the sandbox removes Lua's own libraries." Under
`--policy trusted`, `io.open`, `os.getenv`, `io.popen` and `require` all work today, so a script can
already do these things.

The real reason is that **Lua's own standard library is thin, and the parts it does have are the
wrong shape for a host that cares about determinism.** Lua has no JSON, no regular expressions (its
patterns have no alternation and no `\b`), no hashing, no directory listing, no `stat`, no path
manipulation, and no way to run a process without going through a shell. A script written against
raw Lua ends up shelling out to `python3` — which is the exact situation this crate exists to
remove.

So the modules are not sandbox workarounds. They are better APIs, and being grantable is a second
benefit rather than the motivation.

## Principles

**Every module is a capability.** This is why `path` and `fs` are separate: path manipulation is
pure string math and needs no authority, file access needs a grant. A function that would force a
grant onto a previously-pure module is a design change, not a detail.

**Deterministic by default.** Sorted JSON keys, sorted directory listings, C-locale byte ordering,
stable iteration. Non-determinism here surfaces as spurious diffs and irreproducible builds rather
than as errors, which makes it expensive to find later.

**No shell, ever.** `proc.run` takes an argv array. There is no string form, so quoting bugs are
unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged. `io.popen` takes a shell string, and that is the
single strongest reason to prefer `proc` over it even under `Trusted`.

**Errors are catchable Lua errors,** not sentinel return values, so `pcall` is the one handling
story a script author has to learn.

**Grants are checked in Rust, before the operation.** See [sandbox.md](sandbox.md).

## What ships: `airsstack.json` and `airsstack.path`

`encode`, `encode_pretty`, `decode`. One known gap left, and one closed.

**Object keys sort.** They used to come out in Lua hash order, which varies between runs, so the
same table encoded to a different byte string every time — unusable for an index, a lockfile or any
cached artifact. `convert::sorted` now routes through `Value::to_serializable().sort_keys(true)`
(`mlua-0.12.0/src/value.rs:489` and `:681`), which mlua had all along. Sorting is the behaviour
rather than an option, because a caller could not ask for insertion order anyway — Lua never had it.
Arrays keep their order; only object keys are affected.

**JSON `null` still does not round-trip.** `convert.rs` documents it: `null` decodes to Lua `nil`,
which is indistinguishable from an absent key, so `{"a": null}` and `{}` decode identically. A null
sentinel value fixes it, and the shape of that sentinel is a real API decision — whether `decode`
produces it by default, and how `encode` treats it — which is why it is not simply bolted on ahead
of the module that needs it. It matters more for extensions than for scripts, because extensions
exchange JSON with the host, so it should be settled with `hook`.

`airsstack.path` ships whole — the roster row below is the shipped surface, not a plan. It needs no
authority, so it is installed under every preset including `pure`, and it is the one module whose
behaviour is fully decided by the row in the table.

## Tier 1 — the modules the plugin corpus needs

Validated against the 29 production scripts in `plugins/`, which between them exercise filesystem
walking, subprocess capture, environment lookup, regex, glob matching, hashing, time formatting and
JSON round-trips against real data. That corpus is the acceptance test for this tier, not its
specification: each module is designed for the general case.

| Module | Surface | Grant | Backing crate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | `join`, `dirname`, `basename`, `stem`, `ext`, `normalize`, `relative_to`, `is_absolute`, `absolute` | none | std |
| `fs` | `read`, `read_lines`, `write`, `append`, `exists`, `is_file`, `is_dir`, `stat`, `list`, `walk`, `mkdir`, `remove`, `remove_dir`, `copy`, `rename`, `canonicalize`, `tempfile`, `tempdir`, `atomic_write`, `create_exclusive`, `same_content` | read roots, write roots | `walkdir`, `tempfile` |
| `env` | `get`, `all`, `set` | name allowlist | std |
| `proc` | `run(argv) -> {stdout, stderr, status}`, `which` | executable allowlist | std |
| `regex` | `compile`, `is_match`, `find`, `find_all`, `captures`, `replace`, `replace_all`, `split` | none | `regex` |
| `hash` | `sha1`, `sha256`, `hash_file`, hex encoding | none | `sha2`, plus a SHA-1 crate |
| `time` | `now`, `monotonic`, `format`, `parse` | none | `jiff` |
| `glob` | `match(pattern, path)`, `walk(root, pattern)` | inherits `fs` | `globset` |

All eight are built and every backing crate is now used by the module that named it. `getrandom`
was declared with no module on this roster to consume it and has been removed; `sha1` was added
with `hash`, so the dependency list keeps meaning "something uses this".

Three rows carry a grant, and two more inherit one. `hash_file` and `glob.walk` read the filesystem,
so they go through the same guard `fs` does and need the same read grants — "inherits `fs`" made
concrete rather than left as a note.

### Four requirements that were easy to miss, and how each landed

**`env` needs an allowlist, not just a read grant.** The environment routinely carries credentials.
An extension granted "read env" should see the names it declared, not everything the host process
inherited.

**`fs.create_exclusive` is a concurrency primitive, not a convenience.** It is `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` — an
atomic claim. `plugins/airsstack/hooks/enforce.py:321-335` relies on it for a sentinel claim, and its
comment records that the previous read-then-append design let 3 of 4 concurrent hooks all fire.
Without this function that hook cannot be ported correctly, only approximately.

**`hash` needs SHA-1, not only SHA-256.** `enforce.py:109` uses `hashlib.sha1(...)[:8]` and
`plugins/airsstack-sdd/hooks/ensure-layout.sh` uses `shasum | cut -c1-8`, which is also SHA-1. These
produce the per-repository project key that names the HOME-global SDD spec and plan directories and
the snapshot store. Shipping only SHA-256 silently re-keys every project and orphans existing
artifacts — invisibly, until someone cannot find last week's plan. SHA-256 should be the default for
new uses; SHA-1 exists for compatibility and should be documented as such.

**`glob`'s `**/` must match zero or more segments.** `enforce.py:36-38` makes `**/Cargo.toml` match a
root-level `Cargo.toml`, which is this repository's most important Rust file. `globset` does agree —
checked against that exact case rather than assumed, and pinned by a test that asserts both the
zero-segment and the many-segment match.

## Tier 2 — runtime-class

| Module | Why |
|---|---|
| `stdio` | read stdin, write stdout/stderr, `isatty`. `Restricted` has no `io` at all, and every plugin hook receives its payload on stdin |
| `hook` | the agent-hook contract: parse the payload, emit `hookSpecificOutput`. A thin layer over `stdio` + `json`, already named in `convert.rs:4` |
| `test` | not a module but a runner — `airsl test`. See below |

All three ship. `airsl test` deserves emphasis: the plugin suite has test files that neither
`cargo make dod` nor `.github/workflows/ci.yml` executes — they run under `sh` and `python3` by hand
— and porting several thousand lines of script onto a new runtime without a test story is how a
migration becomes a rewrite with unknown behaviour.

Its conventions are deliberately thin, because each one is something an author has to learn. A test
file is named `*_test.lua` or `test_*.lua`; it returns a table whose named function values are the
tests; a test passes by returning and fails by raising, so Lua's own `assert` is the entire
assertion surface. Each file gets a fresh engine, because sharing one would let a file leave globals
behind for the next — the isolation gap the crate documents, and a test suite is exactly where that
becomes a failure nobody can reproduce alone.

Finding no test files at all exits non-zero. "No tests" and "all tests passed" must not read the
same to CI, which is how a discovery glob that stopped matching goes unnoticed for months.

## Tier 3 — later, each a real project

`http` (settle the async and `Send`/`Sync` questions first — see
[architecture.md](architecture.md)), `sqlite`, `crypto` beyond hashing, and bundling a script plus
its dependencies into a single distributable.

## What is deliberately absent

`fs`, `env` and `proc` are on this list even though `io.open`, `os.getenv` and `io.popen` already
work under `trusted`. That is intentional: the Lua originals cannot be granted, cannot be confined,
and in `io.popen`'s case take a shell string. A script that must run under `confined` has no
alternative to the host module.

A `text` module is deliberately *not* proposed. Lua's `string` library is adequate, and a module that
duplicates it would add surface without adding capability.

## Sequencing

`path` is done: no grants, no I/O, pure functions, and it fixed the module shape, the error
convention and the test harness at the lowest possible cost. Two decisions it settled are worth
carrying forward — a function returns an empty string rather than `nil` for "no extension", so that
absence and failure are never the same value; and `relative_to` refuses a path outside its base
instead of walking up with `..`, because the caller asked "where is this under that", not "how do I
get from one to the other".

Then `fs` and `env`, which unblock most of the plugin corpus and are where the grant machinery gets
designed against something real. The plumbing is in place: `HostModule::install` receives an
`InstallContext` carrying the policy, so a module reads its authority from the same object the
engine reports. What `fs` adds is the vocabulary — the parameterised grant types — plus the answer
to a question `path` never had to face: whether a module the policy has granted nothing is installed
and refuses every call, or is not installed at all so that a script can test for it.

`proc`, `regex`, `hash`, `glob`, `stdio`, `hook` and `airsl test` are all built. What is left is
Tier 3, the JSON `null` sentinel, and porting the plugin corpus itself.
