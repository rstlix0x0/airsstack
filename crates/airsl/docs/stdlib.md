# Host standard library

**Status: `json` is implemented. Everything else on this page is proposed.**

Everything a script can reach arrives under one Lua global, `airsstack`, as subtables installed from
Rust. This document is the roster, the reasoning, and the rules every module follows.

## Why a host stdlib at all

The answer that sounds right and is wrong: "because the sandbox removes Lua's own libraries." Under
`--policy trusted`, `io.open`, `os.getenv`, `io.popen` and `require` all work today, so a script can
already do these things.

The real reason is that **Lua's own standard library is thin, and the parts it does have are the
wrong shape for a host that cares about determinism.** Lua has no JSON, no regular expressions (its
patterns have no alternation and no `\b`), no hashing, no directory listing, no `stat`, no path
manipulation, and no way to run a process without going through a shell. A script written against
raw Lua ends up shelling out to `python3` — which is the exact situation this crate exists to
remove.

So the modules are not sandbox workarounds. They are better APIs, and being grantable is a second
benefit rather than the motivation.

## Principles

**Every module is a capability.** This is why `path` and `fs` are separate: path manipulation is
pure string math and needs no authority, file access needs a grant. A function that would force a
grant onto a previously-pure module is a design change, not a detail.

**Deterministic by default.** Sorted JSON keys, sorted directory listings, C-locale byte ordering,
stable iteration. Non-determinism here surfaces as spurious diffs and irreproducible builds rather
than as errors, which makes it expensive to find later.

**No shell, ever.** `proc.run` takes an argv array. There is no string form, so quoting bugs are
unrepresentable rather than merely discouraged. `io.popen` takes a shell string, and that is the
single strongest reason to prefer `proc` over it even under `Trusted`.

**Errors are catchable Lua errors,** not sentinel return values, so `pcall` is the one handling
story a script author has to learn.

**Grants are checked in Rust, before the operation.** See [sandbox.md](sandbox.md).

## What ships: `airsstack.json`

`encode`, `encode_pretty`, `decode`. One known gap left, and one closed.

**Object keys sort.** They used to come out in Lua hash order, which varies between runs, so the
same table encoded to a different byte string every time — unusable for an index, a lockfile or any
cached artifact. `convert::sorted` now routes through `Value::to_serializable().sort_keys(true)`
(`mlua-0.12.0/src/value.rs:489` and `:681`), which mlua had all along. Sorting is the behaviour
rather than an option, because a caller could not ask for insertion order anyway — Lua never had it.
Arrays keep their order; only object keys are affected.

**JSON `null` still does not round-trip.** `convert.rs` documents it: `null` decodes to Lua `nil`,
which is indistinguishable from an absent key, so `{"a": null}` and `{}` decode identically. A null
sentinel value fixes it, and the shape of that sentinel is a real API decision — whether `decode`
produces it by default, and how `encode` treats it — which is why it is not simply bolted on ahead
of the module that needs it. It matters more for extensions than for scripts, because extensions
exchange JSON with the host, so it should be settled with `hook`.

## Tier 1 — the modules the plugin corpus needs

Validated against the 29 production scripts in `plugins/`, which between them exercise filesystem
walking, subprocess capture, environment lookup, regex, glob matching, hashing, time formatting and
JSON round-trips against real data. That corpus is the acceptance test for this tier, not its
specification: each module is designed for the general case.

| Module | Surface | Grant | Backing crate |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | `join`, `dirname`, `basename`, `stem`, `ext`, `normalize`, `relative_to`, `is_absolute`, `absolute` | none | std |
| `fs` | `read`, `read_lines`, `write`, `append`, `exists`, `is_file`, `is_dir`, `stat`, `list`, `walk`, `mkdir`, `remove`, `remove_dir`, `copy`, `rename`, `canonicalize`, `tempfile`, `tempdir`, `atomic_write`, `create_exclusive`, `same_content` | read roots, write roots | `walkdir`, `tempfile` |
| `env` | `get`, `all`, `set` | name allowlist | std |
| `proc` | `run(argv) -> {stdout, stderr, status}`, `which` | executable allowlist | std |
| `regex` | `compile`, `is_match`, `find`, `find_all`, `captures`, `replace`, `replace_all`, `split` | none | `regex` |
| `hash` | `sha1`, `sha256`, `hash_file`, hex encoding | none | `sha2`, plus a SHA-1 crate |
| `time` | `now`, `monotonic`, `format`, `parse` | none | `jiff` |
| `glob` | `match(pattern, path)`, `walk(root, pattern)` | inherits `fs` | `globset` |

Six of those eight backing crates — `regex`, `globset`, `walkdir`, `sha2`, `jiff`, `tempfile` — are
already declared in `Cargo.toml:48-57` and currently unused. The roster is largely what the commit
that introduced this crate anticipated. A seventh, `getrandom`, was declared with no module on this
roster to consume it and has been removed; the SHA-1 crate the `hash` row needs is deliberately not
declared until `hash` exists, so that the dependency list keeps meaning "something uses this, or is
about to".

### Four requirements that are easy to miss

**`env` needs an allowlist, not just a read grant.** The environment routinely carries credentials.
An extension granted "read env" should see the names it declared, not everything the host process
inherited.

**`fs.create_exclusive` is a concurrency primitive, not a convenience.** It is `O_CREAT|O_EXCL` — an
atomic claim. `plugins/airsstack/hooks/enforce.py:321-335` relies on it for a sentinel claim, and its
comment records that the previous read-then-append design let 3 of 4 concurrent hooks all fire.
Without this function that hook cannot be ported correctly, only approximately.

**`hash` needs SHA-1, not only SHA-256.** `enforce.py:109` uses `hashlib.sha1(...)[:8]` and
`plugins/airsstack-sdd/hooks/ensure-layout.sh` uses `shasum | cut -c1-8`, which is also SHA-1. These
produce the per-repository project key that names the HOME-global SDD spec and plan directories and
the snapshot store. Shipping only SHA-256 silently re-keys every project and orphans existing
artifacts — invisibly, until someone cannot find last week's plan. SHA-256 should be the default for
new uses; SHA-1 exists for compatibility and should be documented as such.

**`glob`'s `**/` must match zero or more segments.** `enforce.py:36-38` makes `**/Cargo.toml` match a
root-level `Cargo.toml`, which is this repository's most important Rust file. Whether `globset`
agrees needs checking against that case specifically rather than assuming.

## Tier 2 — runtime-class

| Module | Why |
|---|---|
| `stdio` | read stdin, write stdout/stderr, `isatty`. `Restricted` has no `io` at all, and every plugin hook receives its payload on stdin |
| `hook` | the agent-hook contract: parse the payload, emit `hookSpecificOutput`. A thin layer over `stdio` + `json`, already named in `convert.rs:4` |
| `test` | not a module but a runner — `airsl test`. See below |

`airsl test` deserves emphasis. The plugin suite has 23 test files, and neither `cargo make dod` nor
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` executes any of them — they run under `sh` and `python3` by hand. Porting
6,285 lines of script onto a new runtime without a test story is how a migration becomes a rewrite
with unknown behaviour. A runner also happens to be one of the things a batteries-included runtime is
expected to ship.

## Tier 3 — later, each a real project

`http` (settle the async and `Send`/`Sync` questions first — see
[architecture.md](architecture.md)), `sqlite`, `crypto` beyond hashing, and bundling a script plus
its dependencies into a single distributable.

## What is deliberately absent

`fs`, `env` and `proc` are on this list even though `io.open`, `os.getenv` and `io.popen` already
work under `trusted`. That is intentional: the Lua originals cannot be granted, cannot be confined,
and in `io.popen`'s case take a shell string. A script that must run under `confined` has no
alternative to the host module.

A `text` module is deliberately *not* proposed. Lua's `string` library is adequate, and a module that
duplicates it would add surface without adding capability.

## Sequencing

`path` first: no grants, no I/O, pure functions. It proves the module shape, the error convention and
the test harness at the lowest possible cost.

Then `fs` and `env`, which unblock most of the plugin corpus and are where the grant machinery gets
designed against something real. `Policy` is settled, so `fs` is unblocked: its composing type ships
with the grant axis typed and empty, waiting for the first module that needs a grant to give the
vocabulary something to constrain.

Then `proc`, `regex`, `hash`, `glob`, then `stdio` and `hook` to finish the migration. `airsl test`
should land early enough to test the modules that follow it rather than last.
