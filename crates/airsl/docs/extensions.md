# Extension system

**Status: proposed.** No part of the negotiation exists — no manifest, no ceiling, no approver, no
dispatcher. What it builds on does: the `HostModule` seam, a per-engine root table, confined
`require`, and resource ceilings all ship. See [architecture.md](architecture.md).

An extension is third-party code that runs inside a host program with capabilities it *requested* and
the host *granted*. That negotiation is the whole difference between an extension system and a
plugin directory.

## The shape of an extension

```
journal-indexer/
  extension.toml
  main.lua
  lib/
    index.lua
    frontmatter.lua
```

```toml
[extension]
name    = "journal-indexer"
version = "0.2.0"
entry   = "main.lua"
api     = 1                      # airsl extension API version

[capabilities]
fs.read   = ["$AIRSSTACK_HOME/journal"]
fs.write  = ["$AIRSSTACK_HOME/journal/.index"]
proc.run  = ["git"]
env.read  = ["AIRSSTACK_HOME", "HOME"]
regex     = true                 # no parameters — pure computation

[capabilities.optional]
proc.run  = ["tar"]              # absence is not fatal

[limits]
memory       = "64MB"
instructions = 50_000_000
```

Three properties of the manifest carry weight:

**A request is a maximum the host may grant, never an entitlement.** The host intersects the request
with its own ceiling. A manifest asking for `fs.read = ["/"]` is not an error; it simply will not be
granted that.

**Variables are expanded by the host, from the host's environment.** If an extension could expand
`$AIRSSTACK_HOME` itself, it could set that variable and widen its own grant. Expansion happens
before the intersection, on the host side, always.

**`api` is declared,** so the contract can evolve without breaking installed extensions.

## Negotiation

Three outcomes: granted, reduced, denied. The decision worth making deliberately is what a
*reduction* does.

**Fail closed by default.** If a required capability is not granted, the extension does not load.
Anything it can genuinely live without goes under `[capabilities.optional]`. Two reasons: an
extension then knows its full authority at startup and needs no defensive branching at every call
site; and a silently-degraded extension — one that looks like it is working and is quietly doing
half its job — is the worst available failure mode.

An extension can still introspect what it received:

```lua
local granted = airsstack.ext.granted()
if granted.proc and granted.proc.run["tar"] then
  -- the optional capability came through
end
```

## The host API

```rust
let host = ExtensionHost::builder()
    .ceiling(Policy::confined()                  // no manifest may exceed this
        .allow(Fs::under("$AIRSSTACK_HOME"))
        .allow(Proc::allow(["git", "tar"])))
    .approver(Approver::manifest())              // or ::interactive(), ::deny_all()
    .build()?;

let ext = host.load("~/.airsstack/extensions/journal-indexer")?;
println!("{:?}", ext.granted());
ext.call("on_session_start", payload)?;
```

The **ceiling** is what makes manifest-driven requests safe to honour at all: it is the host
program's own statement of maximum authority, and nothing a manifest says can exceed it. `Approver`
then decides policy within that bound — honour the manifest, prompt the user, or refuse outright.

For airsstack the natural split follows provenance, and the marketplace at
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` already provides the distinction: marketplace-installed extensions
get `Approver::manifest()`, locally-developed ones get `Approver::interactive()`.

## The Lua side

```lua
-- main.lua
local ext = airsstack.ext

ext.on("session_start", function(payload)
  local root  = airsstack.env.get("AIRSSTACK_HOME") .. "/journal"
  local notes = airsstack.fs.walk(root, { pattern = "*.md" })
  local index = require("lib.index").build(notes)

  airsstack.fs.atomic_write(
    airsstack.path.join(root, ".index", "index.json"),
    airsstack.json.encode_pretty(index, { sort_keys = true })
  )

  return { additionalContext = require("lib.index").card(index) }
end)

return ext
```

`require("lib.index")` resolves only under the extension root. That confinement ships: a target
cannot spell a path separator or a `..` component, the resolved path is canonicalised and checked
for containment, and a cycle raises rather than recursing. Multi-file extensions are no longer
blocked on it.

## Two extension shapes

**Script extensions** run to completion and produce output. This is what `airsl run` does today and
what all 29 plugin scripts are.

**Registered extensions** load once, register handlers, and are called repeatedly by the host as
events occur. This is the Redis model and what "extension system" normally means. It needs three
things that do not exist: the `ext.on` registration API, a host-side dispatcher, and a **persistent
engine across calls**.

That last requirement is where the measurements matter: 4.2 µs per call on a reused engine against
48 µs constructing a fresh one, with 40 µs to build the state. A registered extension pays setup
once and then dispatches in microseconds. Engine reuse is now correct in the places it would
otherwise have been wrong — the instruction counter and the `arg` table are per evaluation,
`require` re-points at the current script's root, its module cache persists as `package.loaded`
does, and evaluations are serialised so threads sharing an engine cannot set each other's arguments.
A long-lived engine still accumulates global state between invocations, and `mlua`'s one-call
environment restore is Luau-only (`mlua-0.12.0/src/state.rs:673`), so isolation between successive
dispatches has to be built.

## What exists versus what is new

| Piece | State |
|---|---|
| `HostModule`, `ModuleSet`, `Engine` | implemented — verified from a downstream crate |
| Per-engine root table, so an extension does not land in someone else's namespace | implemented |
| Confined `require` | implemented |
| Resource ceilings, the `[limits]` block's counterpart | implemented |
| `Policy` composing the axes | implemented — the grant axis is typed and empty |
| Parameterised grants | new — `fs`'s signature depends on them |
| Manifest format and parser | new |
| Ceiling and `Approver` | new |
| `ext.on` registration and host dispatcher | new |
| Capability introspection (`ext.granted`) | new |

## Sequencing, and one caution

**The extension host should come after the standard library, not before.** The grant vocabulary *is*
the module list — a manifest cannot say `fs.read = [...]` before `fs` exists — so building the host
first means designing grants for capabilities that have no implementation to constrain them.

**Versioning needs a decision before the first third-party extension ships.** An extension pins
`api = 1`; modules will grow functions and occasionally change semantics. Whether the guarantee is
"additive only within an api version" or something looser constrains every module signature from
here onward, and it is very hard to tighten afterwards.

## Open questions

- Whether an extension may request a capability the ceiling permits but the *user* has not seen —
  i.e. whether `Approver::manifest()` is acceptable at all for marketplace code, or whether first
  load should always prompt.
- Whether grants are revocable at runtime, or fixed for an engine's lifetime. Fixed is far simpler
  and probably right.
- How a registered extension reports failure without taking down the dispatcher, and whether a
  repeatedly-failing extension gets disabled automatically.
